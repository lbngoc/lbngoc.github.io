## About

My name is Ngoc _(Luong-Bao Ngoc)_ and I am a full-stack web developer with over 8 years of experience in web technologies _(MVC, PHP, WordPress), and  5 years of experiences in mobile app development (Ionic, NativeScript)_, with good knowledge of _Database Design_, _Design Pattern_, _Object-Oriented Analysis, and Design_ (see all [my skills](#technical-skills)).

I really like web standards and technologies, and I have spent most of my time working with them (Angular, Vue, ReactJS, Bootstrap, jQuery, etc…) respectively to cultivate deeper knowledge in these standards. I always want to make all my projects more modern, beautiful, useful, and steady…

At current, I am also the owner of [an IT blog](//ngoclb.com) and working as a part-time freelancer (browse all [my completed projects](//ngoclb.com/portfolio)).
