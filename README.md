# Markdown CV

A jekyll-based markdown CV, which currently looks something like [this](https://cv.ngoclb.com/), see this [blog post](http://blm.io/blog/markdown-academic-cv/) for details. Forked from [blmoore/md-cv](https://github.com/blmoore/md-cv).

### How to use

To build, clone the repo and run jekyll:

```bash
jekyll serve
```
(You may need to [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).)

If you does not have jekyll, you can also use [docker](https://docker.com)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then point your browser to [0.0.0.0:4000](http://0.0.0.0:4000).

### HTML version

The HTML version is generated by Jekyll under `_site` using `media/cv-screen.css`. Most changes from the original repo are artificial:

* more support for mobile devices
* optimize for higher PageSpeed Insight score
* add fadein animation and change some spacing on layout
* messed with colours, fonts
* now imports font-awesome icons and some fonts from Google

### PDF version

To generate PDF file from the source code, you need to install [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) and run

```bash
wkhtmltopdf http://localhost:4000 cv.pdf
```

Note the separate CSS for print and screen media (see `media/cv-print.css`), my approach was to build a somewhat "jazzy" html version and a toned-down print version (for PDF). My changes introduce CSS3 columns in some sections which currently don't print to PDF under the blink/webkit engines (as of March 2015), so to print properly I suggest firefox.

Another problem with the PDF is pagebreaks, they're often not handled gracefully so I've added one in explicitly. Say you want a pagebreak before the section titled "education" (`h2` text is set to `id` so use unique section headers!), the print media CSS would be:

```CSS
#education {
	page-break-before: always;
}
```
